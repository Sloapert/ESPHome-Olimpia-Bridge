## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The component is structured in three main layers, each handling distinct responsibilities:

### Communication Layer
- **`ModbusAsciiHandler`**: The foundation layer implementing the Modbus ASCII protocol
  - Centralized handler with finite state machine (FSM): `IDLE ‚Üí SEND_REQUEST ‚Üí WAIT_RESPONSE ‚Üí PROCESS_RESPONSE`
  - Responsible for all hardware configuration and initialization (UART, RE/DE pins)
  - All communication is LRC-validated with automatic frame verification
  - Hardware-optimized timing for RS-485 half-duplex operation
  - Implements robust request queuing (FIFO), fully asynchronous and non-blocking
  - Per-request callback system for flexible response processing
  - Provides automatic retry on communication errors

### Orchestration Layer
- **`OlimpiaBridge`**: The central coordinator
  - Implements the shared Modbus backend for all climate units
  - Manages device addressing and climate entity coordination
  - Provides direct register access services for configuration

### Climate Control Layer
- **`OlimpiaBridgeClimate`**: Individual zone controller
  - Implements the ESPHome climate interface
  - Manages zone-specific state, configuration, and persistence
  - Handles temperature processing and EMA filtering
  - Controls operation modes and presets
  - Performs state recovery and flash wear leveling for its own zone

1. **Data Flow**
   - External temperature readings from Home Assistant
   - EMA filtering with configurable alpha
   - Trend validation and noise rejection
   - Automatic calibration after inactivity

2. **State Persistence**
   - Flash storage with wear leveling
   - Recovery points for power loss
   - Fallback values for safety

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Is a Good Design

Imagine your home's climate control as a well-orchestrated system where multiple air conditioning units work together seamlessly. This design makes that possible while solving several real-world challenges that users face with smart HVAC systems.

The architecture is built to be rock-solid reliable. Just like a good autopilot system, there's a central "brain" that carefully manages all communication with your AC units. This prevents them from talking over each other and ensures every command gets through correctly. If you have multiple units, they'll all work together harmoniously without interfering with each other - like having a skilled conductor leading an orchestra.

The system proves incredibly resilient to the kinds of problems that plague smart home devices. Power outages? No problem. Network hiccups? Covered. When the power comes back on, your units won't reset to factory settings - they'll remember exactly how you like them and restore those settings automatically. 

The temperature handling system shows particular intelligence. Instead of reacting to every tiny temperature fluctuation (which can make your AC work harder than necessary), it uses sophisticated filtering to ensure smooth, comfortable operation. This is similar to how a car's cruise control smoothly maintains speed without constant acceleration and braking.

The Home Assistant integration demonstrates thoughtful design. The complex inner workings are hidden behind a clean, user-friendly interface. Users get all the benefits of a sophisticated system while keeping the simplicity of controlling their AC units through familiar Home Assistant controls.

For power users, the component includes virtual "Auto" and "Manual" presets that open up interesting automation possibilities. For example, you could create your own Home Assistant automations that use the "Auto" preset as a signal to run your custom climate control logic - perhaps adjusting settings based on time of day, occupancy, or even energy prices. The "Manual" preset could then serve as a temporary override switch: when a room is switched to "Manual", your automations would know to skip that zone while continuing to manage others. When switched back to "Auto", the zone would rejoin your automation scheme. It's like providing the building blocks for a smart override system - how you implement it is up to your imagination and automation skills.
