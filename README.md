# Olimpia Bridge for ESPHome

**Olimpia Bridge** is a custom [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) component that enables full control of Olimpia Splendid fancoil HVAC units over **Modbus ASCII via UART**.

> This component is based on the excellent original project by [@dumpfheimer](https://github.com/dumpfheimer/olimpia_splendid_bi2_modbus_controller) ‚Äî huge thanks for the hard work and reverse-engineering he did made the creation of this component possible!

This ESPHome version replicates the same communication behavior, supports multiple slave units, and integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant using its **native API**. Unlike the original project, it does **not use HTTP or MQTT**, resulting in tighter integration and simpler dynamic configuration with builtin OTA.

## üöÄ Features

- **Modbus ASCII communication** with Olimpia Splendid devices (like B0872 kit)
- Communication behavior and timing comply with official Olimpia Splendid specifications & recommendations
- Full **climate control** (mode, fan speed, target temperature) with state action
- **External ambient temperature** injection (via Home Assistant) with RAM and EEPROM fallback
- Persistent storage of climate state in flash memory with **Powerloss detection & recovery**
- **Robust boot fallback detection and self-healing**
- Optional **water temperature sensor** per unit
- **Support for multiple devices on the same UART bus**
- **Randomized polling & control scheduling** to prevent Modbus collisions
- Custom HA services:  
  - `olimpia_bridge.write_register` (allows writing to configuration registers for advanced tuning parameters)
  - `olimpia_bridge.read_register` (manual reads for debugging) 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

- Centralized **Modbus ASCII handler** manages all communication over RS-485 using a finite state machine (FSM):
  - `IDLE ‚Üí SEND_REQUEST ‚Üí WAIT_RESPONSE ‚Üí PROCESS_RESPONSE`
- Fully **asynchronous and non-blocking**, using a queued request system with per-request callbacks.
- Supports **multiple independent climate units** via per-device Modbus addresses.
- All communication is LRC-validated to ensure protocol integrity.
- Implements automatic **retry and timeout logic**, with detailed logging and recovery paths.
- Built-in support for **dynamic configuration**, sensor injection, and flash persistence.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Is a Good Design

- One central FSM ensures **strict Modbus timing and serialization**, avoiding collisions on the RS-485 bus.
- **Safe multidevice support**: each unit operates independently while sharing the communication backend.
- **Extensible and modular**: climate logic, sensors, and Modbus handling are clearly separated and easily maintained.
- **Reliable recovery**: devices restore control state after power loss using real device reads or flash fallback logic.
- Optimized for **ESPHome + Home Assistant**, providing full state sync, real-time control, and HA-native climate/fan modes.

## üß© Components

- **`ModbusAsciiHandler`**  
  Low-level Modbus ASCII engine that handles frame encoding/decoding, LRC validation, and manages the request queue via a finite state machine (FSM).

- **`OlimpiaBridge`**  
  High-level orchestrator that:
  - Manages UART and RE/DE pin control.
  - Registers the Modbus FSM handler.
  - Coordinates all connected `OlimpiaBridgeClimate` devices.
  - Exposes ESPHome services for direct register read/write.

- **`OlimpiaBridgeClimate`**  
  Represents a climate-controlled zone:
  - Handles state restoration, persistence, and HA UI synchronization.
  - Reads/writes registers 101/102/103 and interprets register 1 (water temp) and 9 (valve status).
  - Supports smart ambient injection via EMA and dynamic target/control logic.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Initialization**
   - Sets up UART communication and RE/DE GPIOs for RS-485 half-duplex.
   - Binds internal Modbus ASCII handler.
   - Registers all climate entities and loads saved control state from EEPROM if available.
   - Performs a boot-time sync by reading registers `101` (control state) and `102` (target temperature) to recover actual device state.
   - If a fallback (AUTO + 22¬∞C) is detected, it restores and re-applies the last known state from flash.

2. **Periodic Control & Polling Loop**
   - Every 60 seconds (with jitter), each unit runs a **control cycle**:
     - `101` ‚Üí Sends control flags (power, mode, fan) as a bitmapped register.
     - `102` ‚Üí Sends target temperature (`¬∞C √ó 10`).
     - `103` ‚Üí Sends ambient room temperature (filtered EMA from HA).
     - Then re-reads `101` and `102` to verify and update current HA state.
   - Every 30 seconds, a **status poll** runs:
     - `9` ‚Üí Reads valve status to infer HVAC action (heating/cooling/idle).
     - `1` ‚Üí Reads water temperature (`¬∞C √ó 10`) and publishes to optional sensor.

3. **Home Assistant Control**
   - Users can change mode, target temp, and fan speed via the standard HA climate entity.
   - Commands are persisted in flash and automatically re-applied after reboots or power loss.

4. **Ambient Temperature Injection & Persistence**
   - Home Assistant pushes ambient temperature via:
     ```yaml
     id(<unit>).set_external_ambient_temperature(x);
     ```
   - Values are smoothed using an **EMA filter** (`ema_alpha`, default `0.2`) with trend confirmation to reject noise.
   - EEPROM save logic prevents flash wear and stores a backup value:
     - On first valid HA update,
     - If temp changes significantly after 1h,
     - Or during fallback boot recovery.
   - If no updates are received for 15 minutes, the EMA resets.
   - On reboot, fallback value is restored and pushed to `103` until HA resumes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure Olimpia Splendid units use Modbus ASCII and follow standard register map.
- The `101 ‚Üí 102 ‚Üí 103` sequence is written cyclically every 60s to meet controller expectations.
- Component ensures proper UART timing, buffer management, and frame parsing as per original controller.

## üß™ Troubleshooting

- **No response from unit**:
  - Ensure correct UART settings: 9600 7E1 (7 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit).
  - Verify RE/DE GPIO wiring matches Olimpia Splendid interface board.
  - Confirm device address matches expected Modbus slave address.

- **Ambient temperature never updates**:
  - Make sure your HA sensor `on_value` lambda is actually pushing data via `.set_external_ambient_temperature(x);`.
  - Enable debug logs in ESPHome (`logger: level: DEBUG`) to verify internal EMA and control logs.

- **Climate entity always shows "OFF"**:
  - Register `101` might be stuck in standby ‚Äî check startup recovery logs.
  - Power-loss fallback may have triggered. Check if state was restored from flash.

## üì¶ Compatibility

- Tested on:
  - ESP32 (ESP32-S3, ESP32-WROOM, LOLIN-S2-MINI)
  - ESP8266 (WEMOS D1 MINI)
  - Olimpia Splendid B0872 Modbus Interface
- Requires:
  - ESPHome ‚â• 2023.8.0
  - Olimpia Splendid units using **Modbus ASCII protocol**
